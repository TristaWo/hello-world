# hello-world
My first repository

Hello everyone! My name is Trista Wang and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Carleton University! I'm always learning new things so this Github will be full of many projects to help improve my understanding.

Outside of coding I love dancing, watching overly niche documentaries and thinking about dogs
